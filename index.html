<p>This is a simple program that moves around items in the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (ALttP). It is used for racing the game.</p>

<p>When racing the game, it is suggested that each player play the same seed to ensure a level playing field.</p>

<p>This was created by Dessyreqt, Karkat, ChristosOwen, and Smallhacker, with input from the SRL ALttP community.</p>

<p>Select a location to save your randomized rom, then select <code>Create</code>.</p>

<p>There are two difficulties, "Casual" and "Glitched". If you don't know which one to pick, select "Casual". You can also create a non-randomized ROM, to play the classic game with the changes to the rom file we've added.</p>

<p>You can slow down the low-health warning or turn it off using the "Heart Beep Speed" dropdown box.</p>

<p>Enabling the "SRAM Trace" option will allow the rom's SRM file to automatically populate Zarby89's HUD, which can be found at <a href="https://zarby89.github.io/ZeldaHud/">https://zarby89.github.io/ZeldaHud/</a></p>

<p>"Show complexity" will display the number of steps to collect all of the items in the generated rom (explained more clearly in the spoiler log.)</p>

<p>"Check for Updates on Startup" will disable update checking. I'd recommend you leave this on, but if it's problematic to check due to your network situation, I understand.</p>

<p>Randomizing the game definitely tests how well you know it. Here's a few places where people commonly get stuck.</p>

<p>There are a number of differences from a randomized game to the normal game. Here's a short list:</p>

<ul>
<li>The game text is in Japanese <em>(this obviously isn't different if you are used to playing in Japanese. See below for why.)</em></li>
<li>Chest items, heart pieces, boss hearts, medallions, pendants, crystals, capacity upgrades, the Book of Mudora, and items given to you by NPCs are randomized. Note that this doesn't include chests in the various chest games throughout Hyrule.</li>
<li>The rupee maximum is now 9999.</li>
<li>You can't turn the tree kid to wood. This is to prevent being unable to get his item.</li>
<li>Escaping the castle at the beginning of the game no longer requires the lamp.</li>
<li>In the light world, you don't need the Lamp to see in the dark.</li>
<li>In the dark world, the crystals will display on your inventory screen even if you haven't defeated Agahnim.</li>
<li>The 70 Arrow and 50 bomb upgrades are now items you can find, along with the 1/2 and (previously unused) 1/4 Magic upgrades.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some bugs that wouldn't crop up in normal play have been fixed:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you die in a Dark World dungeon and haven't defeated Agahnim, you will end up in what's known as "fake Dark World." This will sometimes cause the Crystal at the end of the dungeon to not spawn, causing a softlock. You cannot spawn in "fake Dark World" in randomizer.</li>
<li>If you collect Power Gloves after collecting Titan's Mitt, your gloves will downgrade and you will be stuck without a way to lift dark rocks. This will not happen in randomizer.</li>
<li>If you collect the key in the big chest room in the Swamp Palace <em>(due to having hookshot earlier than normal)</em>, then use that key on the top left door of that room, you can cause a soft lock due to being unable to access that key. In randomizer, moving one screen on the overworld away from the entrance to Swamp Palace will reset the water both around Swamp Palace, and the water that would cover those keys.</li>
<li>If you defeat Agahnim and never found the Magic Mirror, you will be stuck in the Dark World with no way to return to the light world. In randomizer, saving and quitting will cause you to load up in the Light World.</li>
<li>Occasionally Agahnim will attack you with particles that can't be reflected back at him. In randomizer, this doesn't happen.</li>
<li>If you take damage while using the "fake flippers" glitch, the game may enter a locked state where all input is ignored. In randomizer, you will instead die and have all faeries removed from your inventory, allowing you to continue with the game.</li>
<li>If you flute from the Master Sword grove or save &amp; quit, it may be possible to have an invisible follower following you. This would prevent you from entering the Dark Palace as Kiki won't follow you if you already have a follower. In randomizer, this has been fixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>There isn't much text left in the game, but some of what you will find is in Japanese.</p>

<p>This randomizer uses the 1.0 JP version of the base rom because it is what is primarily used in speedrunning ALttP. Here are some of the features of this version compared to the English version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Faster text speed. This is very noticeable during the introduction.</li>
<li>After getting the Pegasus Boots, pressing <code>Y</code> + <code>A</code> will allow you to use an item and dash at the same time. For a clear example of this working, try hammer dashing at the bridge leading from Dark Palace to Swamp Palace.</li>
<li>You can jump down from a wall of which you are partially inside. This is most useful above the section of Turtle Rock that leads to the Mirror Shield.</li>
<li>In an area where you can't use the Magic Mirror, you can make pushed blocks disappear by trying to use it while pushing the blocks.</li>
<li>You can enter the Exploration Glitch in Tower of Hera by falling down the rightmost hole on the 3F, then jumping right from the wall.</li>
</ul>
